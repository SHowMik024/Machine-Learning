This project aims to predict loan approval status
 using various machine learning models on a structured financial
 dataset. The models implemented include Logistic Regression,
 Naive Bayes, and Neural Network (MLPClassifier). The dataset
 underwent extensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
 to identify relationships among variables. Key steps involved
 handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and
 addressing class imbalance. Performance metrics such as accu
racy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score were used
 to evaluate each model. The Neural Network model yielded the
 highest accuracy and AUC score, demonstrating strong potential
 for loan classification tasks.
